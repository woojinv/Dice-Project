# Random-Dice-Generator

## Description

This was my [first project](https://woojinv.github.io/Random-Dice-Generator/) that confirmed my desire to become a software engineer!

It was built using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 


## What I learned

I learned that the amount of satisfaction and fulfillment I got from fulfilling user stories and solving bugs far exceeded what I could get from my previous career, so I decided to make the switch.
